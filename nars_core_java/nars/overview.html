        NARS overview

        <h2>Package Specification</h2>

        The code for distribution is <tt>NARS.jar</tt>, in Java 1.6.0_17.
        <p>
        It works both as an application (with full functionality) and an applet 
        (with restricted functionality and display).
        <p>
        To run the application from the command line, go to the folder containing NARS.jar 
        and type the following:
        <pre>
            java -jar "NARS.jar"
        </pre>
        To run the applet in a browser, open an HTML file, which is in the folder 
        containing NARS.jar, and has the following line in it:
        <pre>
            &lt;applet ARCHIVE="NARS.jar" CODE="nars.main.NARS"&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;
        </pre>
