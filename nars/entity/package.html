<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<ul>
<li>ShortFloats: BudgetValue (priority/durability/quality) and TruthValue (frequency/confidence)</li>
<li>Stamp: serial numbers associated to TruthVallue</li>
<li>Sentence: a Term, a TruthValue, and a Stamp. A Sentence can be a Judgment, a Goal, or a Question.</li>
<li>Task: a Sentence to be processed.</li>
<li>TermLink: built in pair between a compound term and a component term.</li>
<li>TaskLink: special TermLink refering to a Task, whose Term equals or contains the current Term.</li>
<li>Concept: labeled by a Term, contains a TaskLink bag and a TermLink bag for indirect tasks/beliefs, as well as beliefs/questions/goals directly on the Term.</li>
<li>Item: Concept, Task, or TermLink</li>
<li>TemporalValue: A relative time used in Sentence (for tense), Conjunction (for order), and Implication/Equivalence (for time interval)</li>
</ul>    

in NARS, each task is processed in two stages:
<ol>
<li>Direct processing by matching, in the concept corresponding to the content, in one step. It happens when the task is inserted into memory.</li>
<li>Indirect processing by reasoning, in related concepts and unlimited steps. It happens in each inference cycle.</li>
</ol>
The transmission from (1) to (2) corresponds to "decision making".
<p>
Inference between premises with no shared term can only happen among new events, as temporal induction/comparison.
