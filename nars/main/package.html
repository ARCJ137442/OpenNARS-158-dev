Top-level classes of the system

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This package contains the top classes of the system.
<p>
<tt>NARS</tt> defines the application and applet. When NARS runs as an applet, it is for demonstration only, and certain functionalities are blocked.
<p>
<tt>Parameters</tt> collects all system parameters, which can be edited before compiling.
<p>
<tt>Memory</tt> maintains the work space of the system, including
<ul>
<li>a bag of concept,</li>
<li>a look-up table of all built-in operators,</li>
<li>a queue for new results to be processed in each cycle,</li>
<li>a task buffer for new results to be processed in the future.</li>
</ul>
Each of the above occupies constant space.
<p>
Memory and all of its variables are static, so each is unique, and can be referred by name anywhere in the system.
